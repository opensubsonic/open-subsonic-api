`http://your-server/rest/scrobble` Since [1.5.0](../../subsonic-versions)

Registers the local playback of one or more media files. Typically used when playing media that is cached on the client. This operation includes the following:

- "Scrobbles" the media files on last.fm if the user has configured his/her last.fm credentials on the server.
- Updates the play count and last played timestamp for the media files. (Since [1.11.0](../../subsonic-versions))
- Makes the media files appear in the "Now playing" page in the web app, and appear in the list of songs returned by `getNowPlaying` (Since [1.11.0](../../subsonic-versions))

Since [1.8.0](../../subsonic-versions) you may specify multiple `id` (and optionally `time`) parameters to scrobble multiple files.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Req. | OpenS. | Default | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | **Yes** |   |  | A string which uniquely identifies the file to scrobble. |
| `time` | No  |  |   | (Since [1.8.0](../../subsonic-versions)) The time (in milliseconds since 1 Jan 1970) at which the song was listened to. |
| `submission` | No | | True | Whether this is a "submission" or a "now playing" notification. |
