## What is OpenSubsonic API?

The OpenSubsonic API allows anyone to build their own programs using a compatible server, whether they're on the web, the desktop, or on mobile devices. All the OpenSubsonic-compatible apps (clients and servers) are built using the OpenSubsonic API.

The OpenSubsonic API allows you to call methods that respond in [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) style XML or JSON. Since most clients now only rely on JSON, this documentation only shows the JSON answers in the documentation.

This project is built upon the original [Subsonic API](https://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp).

See:

- [OpenSubsonic API](./opensubsonic-api) for the API documentation.
- [Goals](#goals) for some of the goals of this project.
- [Issues](#addressing-issues-with-the-subsonic-api) for some of the issues this project tries to solve over the original API.

## Participants

OpenSubsonic is built with servers and clients trying to improve the global media center ecosystem by providing a common expandable API that can fit most of the needs of modern music apps.

Any server or client can join the organization and make proposals [OpenSubsonic](https://github.com/opensubsonic/open-subsonic-api/discussions). The only condition is that if (as a client) you request an API extension that is accepted, you engage yourself in implementing it in your client in a timely manner.

## Goals

The OpenSubsonic API has several goals, which include:

- Being an open, collaboratively maintained specification.
- Ensuring security across all extensions.
- Maintaining complete backwards compatibility with the existing Subsonic API.
- Offering piecewise optional implementation for servers and clients.

## Addressing Issues with the Subsonic API

Some of the issues the OpenSubsonic API aims to address include:

- Outdated and insecure authentication methods.
- Suboptimal versioning schema.
- Insufficient methods for expressing server functionality.
- Lack of an open and collaborative way to evolve the API.

By extending the existing Subsonic API, the OpenSubsonic API hopes to create a more secure, flexible, and collaborative environment for the Subsonic ecosystem.
