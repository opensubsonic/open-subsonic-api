Ideally, the server will return lang as an ISO 639 (2/3) code. However, tagged files and external lyrics can come with any value as a potential language code, so clients should take care when displaying lang.\n\nFurthermore, there is special behavior for the value xxx. While not an ISO code, it is commonly used by taggers and other parsing software. Clients should treat xxx as not having a specified language (equivalent to the und code)."
